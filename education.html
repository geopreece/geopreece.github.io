    <div class="panel">
        <p><b>Institution:</b> Manchester Metropolitan University</p>
        <p><b>Degree:</b> BEng Mechanical Engineering (Hons)</p>
        <p><b>Classification:</b> 1st Class Honours</p>
        <p><b>Time period:</b> 2017-2020</p>
        <button class="accordion">Dissertation</button>
        <div class="panel panelContent">
            <p>I completed the only client supervised dissertation in my cohort in designing and developing the patent for a multi-phase Tesla turbine. Nikola Tesla is really inspiring to me, theorising and understanding things way beyond his era and what was possible at the time, so to work on a technology he invented was fun.</p>
            <p>In my final year we could only select so many units to study. In order to get as thorough coverage of areas as possible I decided not to do the fluid mechanics module and to focus on a fluids topic for my dissertation. I looked to research wind turbine blade design as I have a decent understanding of how the engineering works, with blade length and wind speed having non-linear affects on power. </p>
            <p>The opportunity to work on Tesla turbine design instead was even better as I took the opportunity to study drag and the boundary layer effect more. I think this gave me a thorough learning experience of fluid mechanics despite opting for other units.</p>
            <p>It was extremely disappointing that pandemic restrictions prohibited lab testing of the turbine but CFD simulations on Solidworks allowed me to see how the fluid would interact with the system. The simulations showed great promise for the design and I would have loved to see how it did in practice.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Other Projects</button>
        <div class="panel panelContent">
            <p>Other favourite projects include the design of efficient homeless housing units in Manchester to meet cost, occupancy and energy targets. The site was designed in a horseshoe shape to create a sense of community. The use of MATLAB allowed energy use projections to factor in the impact of changes in materials, dimensions and recommend appropriate solar panel and battery storage capacity.</p>
            <p>Another was my Engineering Management coursework. We were given the task of creating a business plan for a unique and efficient ceramic tile manufacturing company. Decisions had to be taken on the extent of automation, ecological impact and scale of the business. When doing research I opted to pursue a business plan with more sustainable production and less waste with things like microwave assisted single firing kilns to reduce the amount of gas burned per unit.</p>

                <p>Wanting to ensure I have marketable skills to add to my education and work experience, I enrolled on this 3-week full-time course to acquire skills in Python, HTML & CSS.</p>
                <p>I undertook solo and team projects on the course. We were tasked with building a website in the final week using HTML and CSS (not this site). I wanted to make it fun and unique so drew a little cartoon stick-man and then mapped the image so when clicking on a certain part of the stickman, the user would be taken to a corresponding page. Clicking the head/brain would take the user to an Education page, the heart would got to passions and so on. Sizing the mapped areas and identifying coordinates on the image opened my eyes to what kind of things can be done in web development even with just the basics.</p>

                <p>Since the course I have been chipping away at this site and getting through the backlog of ideas I have had for it! This is the first time I have used JavaScript and although it is very new to me I think I am beginning to get the grasp of how it works. As someone new to code, and perhaps naively, I think JavaScript is basically Python for WebDev.</p>
                <p>The JavaScript I have used, as it stands, is for the 'Back to Top' buttons and the expandable accordions on the Education page. I love what they've added and I've got plans for more use of JavaScript. I have an overflowing bank of ideas and can't wait tp use this site as a platform for my creativty and learning.</p>
